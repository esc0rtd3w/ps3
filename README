You can easily identify export / import structures in a memory dump by looking 
for the module name (such as "cellNetCtl_Library"), before the name there will 
be several structures starting with 0x1C followed by more structures starting 
with 0x2C. 0x1C structures are exports, 0x2C structures are imports.
